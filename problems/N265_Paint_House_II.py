265. Paint House II
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. 
The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. 
You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix.
For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... 
Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5;
Â             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.
Follow up:
Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?
